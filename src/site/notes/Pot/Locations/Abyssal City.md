# The Abyssal City
#dungeon #location
[[Abyssal City - Secret\|Abyssal City - Secret]]

An ancient city located deep under the ocean of the [[Pot/Locations/Kingdom of Pot\|Bay of Pot]]. Part of [[Pot/Locations/Fofam\|Fofam]]'s economy is based around scavenging this city, but the danger and inaccessibility has made the profession unique and highly skilled.  

A descent into the city during the day yields regular scavenging, but at night a change occurs.
The water becomes thinner and darker, more so the deeper you go. At the upper levels of the city, you still need oxygen, but the lower you get, the more you can breathe the water. It becomes like a thick black fog. Nobody has made it all the way down to the base. Or made it down to the base and returned.
