# The City of Shoe

## Description

### Entering from the Southern Entrance

First players pass by the outer fields of the city. Past the fields of golden wheat they see the tall cobble walls of the outer wall of Shoe. Open wooden doors guarded by a few guards chilling outside a short guard tower. Past the fair wooden gates lies the southernmost outer ward of the city. A quaint neighborhood, there are a few houses that are disconnected with gated yards, some houses and shops all connected up, wide streets with trees and other greenery. This part of the city is colorful and cheerful. There's a sense of business in the air the air but not stress. This is a middle class neighborhood. The cobble street winds gently till it stops before a lightly cracked tan marble set of steps that lead up into the grand entrance of the inner city. The walls of the inner city are extremely tall, 50ft, and made of large marble bricks. They covered in lime green and dark olive vines with pink blossoms. The walls are classic massive fantasy walls. The gate is huge and ornately carved but eroded down so much it's hard to tell exactly what it is. Two massive shield guardians guard the gate, but don't look like they moved in centuries. Past the gates, you enter the stretch, the main hub of life in Shoe.

### The Shady Side

The Shady side itself is built on the western edge of plastic city, squashed against the cliffside. A low cloud constantly hangs over the city. A cloudy day for Shoe is rainy day on the Shady Side. Worse, a rainy day for shoe is a snowstorm for the Shady Side. The air smells like mildew and mildly like burning garbage. Loose dogs, cats, and other pet rats wander the quiet streets, and the ground is damp with rain.

Although the Shady Side is technically a part of Shoe it's not treated as such by the local government. The Shady Side is filled by people on the edge of society, by choice or otherwise. Vagrants wander the ward and sleep on the streets. Criminals deal in broad daylight. Sewage piles up in alleyways and corners. Paupers make do with what they can. The blocks of the city are densely packed with apartment blocks of shoddy constructions. Many are boarded up. The streets a quiet and vendor-less. However, despite the doom and gloom, there is a certain hope to this place. People play dice in the street, and set up around tables outside shops playing board games. They plant ferns in the dirt on the street, and put out potted plants around doors and window sills. They feed the locals birds, and give food to the homeless when they can.

### The Industrial District

Anything that produces smoke, noise, or stench ends up here in the industrial district. It's crowded with automaton reclamation centers, armorers, weapon smiths, brick makers, warehouses, and anything of that manner. A few shops are open here, but most have store fronts in the main city. A rare house or two can be found in the district, but they're oddities. The ones that are here might be the house of a blacksmith over their shop or an odd apartment complex that feeds a nearby factory. A thick low fog hangs over on the ground in the mornings and some light is always flickering in the night. The area is fairly free of criminals because its patrolled by government officials like safety inspectors and tax collectors.

### Minor Neighborhoods

**High Tower.** A smallest neighborhood in the southwestern corner built around the largest barbican of the middle wall. The high elf immigrants live in the barbican itself, while the lower neighborhood is a middle-class mismatch of halflings, half-elves, gnomes, and a few of the lawful wildlings. High tower is also the quietest of the neighborhoods. The high elves keep to themselves in the tower while the lower neighbors keep themselves neatly organized and mostly separated. The streets wind around small patches of green with well-trimmed gardens and greenery. The houses and shops of High Tower are all very well built, but very dramatically in size to compensate for the residence. The gnomes have houses built like towers with small bases and roofs the creep up to the height of the walls. The halflings have short, but wide houses with beautiful gardens in front.

**South Field.** The largest of the neighborhoods in Shoe. It's primary residence are Gorcs, Half-Gorcs, Wildlings, Humans and Dwarves, but in smaller populations it has fairies, gnomes, elves half and otherwise, halflings. However, every lineage can be found in some amount in South Field. South Field is much less cramped than the Main Stretch. Houses and shops are built more sturdy and more organized in colorful wood, waddle, and daub. Lawns are replaced by food gardens and benches are replaced with small stalls. Unlike the bustling sounds of the Main Stretch, you can hear childish laughter, light scolding, and clanging pots. The street smells like candles, fire, and lightly of fruits.

**East Gate.** A middle sized neighborhood of Shoe. It's primarily composed of orcs, half-orcs, goliaths, dragonborns, weirds, tieflings, enoki, more chaotic wildlings, and goblins. East Gate isn't poor, but it's not as put together as South Field. A few large ornate houses stick out among smaller less kept houses and shops. The vines of Shoe climb up many of the walls in East Gate and consume abandoned homes. The streets are flooded with the smells from the numerous carts selling street food. A few bards busk on the street corners. A young goblin chases a tiefling child in the street and splash through puddles.

**Starboard.** One of the smaller neighborhoods of Shoe, Starboard is lavish riverside neighborhood. On the river front, variegated colonial houses face the water with well-maintained docks dotted with cabanas and boat houses. Museums and art houses are a common fixture here, and upscale boutiques, taverns, and coffee-houses bring in a well-manner crowd. However, the neighborhood progressively blends into its surrounding districts. At the edges of the neighborhood, the influence of the nearby industry and shade is seen. Abandoned mills pile up on the industrial side and mold grows on the shady side.
