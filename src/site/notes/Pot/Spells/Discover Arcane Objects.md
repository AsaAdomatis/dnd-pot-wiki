 **Discover Arcane Objects**
_2nd-level divination_  
**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** Self (30-foot radius)  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** 10 minutes

You open your awareness to the presence of magical objects in your vicinity. For the duration, you sense the location of any magical item within 30 feet of you that is not behind total cover. For each item detected, you learn the following:

- Its **general category** (such as weapon, armor, potion, ring, staff, wondrous item, etc.).
- Its **rarity** (common, uncommon, rare, very rare, or legendary).
- Whether the item requires **attunement**.
- Whether it is **currently attuned** to a creature.

This spell does **not** identify cursed items or reveal specific magical effects or properties.

The spell is not blocked by invisibility, but it cannot detect items behind 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, or a thin sheet of lead. This spell does not require concentration.
