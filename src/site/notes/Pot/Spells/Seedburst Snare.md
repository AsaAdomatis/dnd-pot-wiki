**Seedburst Snare**
*1st-Level Conjuration*  
**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** 30 feet  
**Components:** V, S, M (a dried thorned seed)  
**Duration:** 1 minute

You hurl a magically charged seed to a point within range. Upon landing, it rapidly takes root and erupts into a mass of thorned vines to a 5-foot cube centered on that point.
- The area becomes **difficult terrain** for the duration.
- Each creature in the area when the seed lands must succeed on a **Strength saving throw** or take **2d6 piercing damage** and be pushed **5 feet** away from the center of the vines. On a success, they take half damage and are not pushed.
- The first time a creature enters the area or starts its turn there, it must make a Strength saving throw or take **1d6 piercing damage** and be pushed 5 feet in a direction of your choice.

The vines wither at the end of the duration or if you dismiss them early as a bonus action.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the initial damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st.
