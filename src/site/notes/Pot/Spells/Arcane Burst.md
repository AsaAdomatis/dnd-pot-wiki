**Arcane Burst**
_1st-Level Evocation (Archivist)_  
**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** 60 feet  
**Components:** V, S, M (a small object from your Portable Archive, worth at least 1 sp)  
**Duration:** Instantaneous

You extract a stored item from your archive and hurl it toward a target, imbuing it with volatile magic. Choose one damage type: **force, fire, lightning, radiant, necrotic, cold, thunder, or acid**. Make a ranged spell attack against a creature within range. 
- On hit, the target becomes Vulnerable to the chosen type for 1 minute.
- Then, hit or miss, the target and each creature within **5 feet** of the target must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes **2d6** damage of the same type. On a successful save, it takes half as much.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, its damage increases by **1d6** for each slot level above 1st.
