# Gravity Shift
_1st-level Transmutation_  
**Casting Time:** 1 bonus action  
**Range:** 15-foot cone  
**Components:** V  
**Duration:** Instantaneous  
**Classes:** Riven, Sorcerer, Wizard

You unleash a ripple of planar force that distorts gravity in a 15-foot cone originating from you. Choose one: pull or push.

Each creature in the cone must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be **moved 10 feet** in the chosen direction (toward or away from you) and take **1d6 force damage**. On a successful save, a creature takes half damage and isn't moved.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st.
