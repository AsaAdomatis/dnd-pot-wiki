### Minor Deities
Minor deities most are most often Guardians and Champions.

Guardians are beings blessed by titans with supernatural power. They represent the true nature of a place or location and maintain that nature. Titans do not choose particular beings to be their guardians, but instead the beast connection to an essence creates the bond. The longer a location has stayed the same, the more powerful the Guardian. 

On the other hand, champions are the chosen of the gods blessed with their own divine power. They represent the god's will for change and its desire to directly impact the world. God's can have any number of champions, but often have no more than three as to not dilute their power. The greater the change a champion creates in the shorter amount of time, the more powerful they grow. Therefore, its common for a god to bestow the role of champion on being after the fact as a signifier of their approval.
