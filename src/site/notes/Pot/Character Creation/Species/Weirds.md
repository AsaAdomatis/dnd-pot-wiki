## Quick Ideas
- intraplanar quakes happen so often, causing the elemental planes to smash into the material plane and creating [traditional weirds](http://dndroll.wikidot.com/creatures:water-weird)
	- Weirds are traditional weirds blessed by a god to gain sentience and given an [[anchor\|anchor]] inscribed with magical runes to allow them to shape themselves and move throughout the world
- Some sort of elemental form that grows in power
- A few elemental skills and boons depending on the element
- Asexual reproduction, birthed by accident or by other weirds intentionally creating a child
	- Born fully formed, by not skillful and therefore appearance is different by size isn't
	- Intentional reproduction means strong sense of community and responsibility in deciding to create a new life form
	- Intentional and religious reproduction means highly indoctrinating and strict cultural practices
- Undeath because can only die when [[anchor\|anchor]] loses energy or when pulled from the heart of the weird
	- Life length depends on strength of the magic and quality of the ruin, usually 80-200 years
- Weirds possess minor illusory magic that allows them to mostly customize the appearance, even more so with life experience
# Old Version
### History

Weirds are the conscious counterparts to elementals. They lived in the elemental planes as the main habitants of the capital cities. At the beginning of the modern era, the planes began to rotate causing chaos in each of the kingdom and an exodus of many of its inhabitants. Although the disaster is now long over, many weirds have found a home in Pot among its inhabitants. While in separate planes weirds each had their own customs and traditions, they have assimilated into a single cultural unit in Pot.

### Society

Weirds like to live around other weirds, especially those of the same element. They prefer living in large cities like the capitals of their home planes and in areas similar to their home planes. They revere their home plane and its element as somewhat sacred, but this tradition is mostly maintained in the older of the weirds. A pious fire weird might also keep their hearth burning in their house, or a water weird, their fountain running. They also tend to hold themselves in a higher light the other lineages, believing they are the most pure humanoids.
