### Physical Description

Enokis appearance's vary based on the fruiting body of the fungus they grew from. They lack a neck and their bodies and limbs are extensions of the mushroom's stalk.

### Society

Enoki society revolves around the mycelium network and the collective unconsciousness within it. Enoki are the fruiting bodies that once grew from the network and have separated into the own being. However, they still retain a piece of the collective dream. When Enoki are young, they live in their homeland with elders Enoki who instill wisdom of the outside world into them. When they reach adulthood, most Enoki leave the colony to search for adventure and experience. Once they have lived a life worth living they return home to the colony and eventually to the network itself, imparting the mycelian dream with the experiences of their lives.

### Enoki Names

Since Enoki do not need to communicate verbally, they do not develop true names until they leave their colony. The names they adopt are representative of their core identity from the dream. In the minds of humanoids, these names often expressed in short phrase.
