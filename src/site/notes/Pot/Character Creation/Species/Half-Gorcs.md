> The marriage between a Gorc and a Human isn't terribly rare making the Half-Gorc a well-known species. However, the fervent hunger for knowledge of the Gorc is tempered by human blood. Half-Gorcs don't have the thirst of Gorcs, and instead they seek to differentiate themselves from Orcs by trying to be incredibly kind. Half-Gorcs appear all across the Kingdom of Pot, but often accumulate in cities. They have a similar appearance to Half-Orcs except their skin tends more to a sky blue.

- **Ability Score Increase.** Your Strength score increase by 2 and your Charisma score increases by 1.
- **Creature Type.** You are Humanoid
- **Size.** Half-Gorcs are somewhat larger and bulkier than humans, and they range from 5 to well over 6 feet tall. Your size is Medium.
- **Age.** Half-Gorcs mature a little faster than humans, reaching adulthood around age 14. They age noticeably faster and rarely live longer than 75 years.
- **Speed.** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.
- **Darkvision.** Thanks to your Gorc blood, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.
- **Friendly.** You have advantage on Charisma checks that involve convincing people to be less hostile or friendly.
- **Proud Heritage.** Despite being only Half-Gorc, you are proud when you can represent your lineage as one of intellect. When someone asks you a question that would require a DC 15 or higher intelligence check to answer, you can make an intelligence saving throw to answer immediately. On a success, you feel proud and gain 1d4 temporary hit points. The temporary hit points increase to 2d4 at 6th level, 3d4 at 11th level, and 4d4 at 16th level. After a success, you can't use this trait until you finished a long rest.
- **Merciful Attacks.** Your kindness precedes you, and your fumbling is interpreted as mercy. When you score a critical fail with a melee weapon attack, there are no negative consequences, and until the end of your next turn, attacks against you have disadvantage.
- **Languages.**Â  You can speak, read, and write Common and Orc.
