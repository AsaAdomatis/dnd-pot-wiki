> Astralians are travelers from the Astral Plane. They have been visiting the Realm long before any written history. They don't usually stay around, but some are known to occupy pods of two to four members. While they show up everywhere, they are most commonly found in high altitudes and dry deserts, both hot and cold. Astralians have clammy screen ranging from a bright, lime green to a dark pale gray. They have no mouths, small holes for ears, and large pitch black oval eyes.


- **Ability Score Increase.** Your Intelligence score increases by 2.
- **Age.** Astralians have no known age because little is known about their origin. When asked how old they are, they often respond in esoteric phrases and numbers.
- **Size.** Astralians are shorter in stature ranging from 2.5-5ft. Your size is medium.
- **Speed.** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.
- **Dark Vision.** Your long periods in the darkness between the Astral Planes has adapted you for living in darkness. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.
- **Psyonic Abilities.**  You know the Dancing Lights cantrip. Starting at 3rd level, you can cast the Dissonant Whispers spell with this trait. Starting at 5th level, you can also cast the [[Pot/Spells/Abduction\|Abduction]] spell with this trait. Once you cast Dissonant Whispers or Abduction with this trait, you can’t cast that spell with it again until you finish a long rest. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for these spells when you cast them with this trait.
- **Telepathy.** Having no mouth, you cannot speak. Instead you use telepathy to convey your thoughts. You have the magical ability to transmit your thoughts mentally to willing creatures within 120 feet of yourself. A contacted creature doesn’t need to share a language with you to understand your thoughts, but it must be able to understand at least one language. Your telepathic link to a creature is broken if you and the creature move more than 120 feet apart, if either of you is incapacitated, or if either of you mentally breaks the contact (no action required).
- **Languages.** You can speak, read, and write in Common and Astralian.
