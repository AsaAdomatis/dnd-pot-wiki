# Channeling Techniques

### Pulse

As an action, you may expend a number of Channeling Points - at least 1 - to release a pulsing wave of energy around you. Each creature within 10 feet of you must make a Strength Saving Throw. A creature takes 1d4 force damage for each Channeling Point you expended as is pushed 5 feet away from your on a failed save, and half as much damage and isn't pushed back on a successful one.

---
### Sacrifice
Kills yourself but blow up everything in AOE with unavoidable damage

**Prerequisite:** Level 8+ Conduit, Pulse Channeling Technique

---
### Blast
Kamehameha

---
### Barrage

As an action, you may expend a number of Channeling Points - at least 1 - to release a barrage of energy blasts in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 1d4 force damage per Channeling Point expended. 

---
### Blind

As an action, you may expend 2 Channeling Points to unleash a flash of searing magical energy in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in the area must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature is blinded until the end of its next turn. On a successful save, the creature is unaffected.

---
### Bolt
You can spend a number Channeling Points to take two of any combination of the Dodge, Dash and Disengage actions as an action on your turn. When you do, your movement speed increase by 5 feet for each Channeling Point expended until the end of the turn.

---
### Smoke Veil

When you're struck by an attack after already being damaged this round, you expend a Channeling Point and use your reaction to kick up mist and dust around yourself, shrouding yourself in a dense fog. A 20-foot-radius sphere of fog centered on you spreads out and heavily obscures the area. The effect mimics the fog cloud spell, but:
- It does not require concentration.
- The effect immediately ends if you move or make an attack, or cast another spell.

While the fog persists, you are hidden from view, evoking the mysterious stillness before the smoke clears.

---
### Fly

As a bonus action, you can expend 1 Channeling Point to gain a flying speed equal to your movement speed until the start of your next turn. If you use this Channeling technique sequentially, there is no down time between flying, and you do not fall out of the sky.
