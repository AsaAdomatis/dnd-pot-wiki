As a Empath, you gain the following class features when you reach the specified Empath levels. These features are listed in the Empath Features table.

### Level 1: Emotional Governance

*Beginning at 1st level*, *your insight into emotions gives you true governance over them.* 

Your access to this well of emotional energy is represented by a number of **Mote Dice**. Your empath level determines how many mote dice you have and of what kinds, as show in the Mote Dice column of the Empath Feature table (part B).

You can expend these dice to fuel various empathic features. Whenever a feature requires you to expend your **Mote Dice**, you can expend additional dice after seeing the result to increase the result.

When you spend a Mote Dice, it is unavailable until you finish a long rest, which during you experience a fit of emotions or meditate on your emotions, refueling your intrinsic power. You must spend at least 30 minutes in a fit of emotions or meditating to fully restore your mote dice. A fit of emotions can occur as a nightmare or a dream during your sleep.

Some of your mote features require your target to make a saving throw to resist the feature's effects. The saving throw DC differs based on the emotion you channel into the feature. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:

- **Mote Save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your mote ability modifier (Wisdom or Charisma)

#### Learning Emotions

At 1st level, you know 2 emotions from the [[Pot/Character Creation/Class & Subclasses/Empath Emotions List\|Empath Emotions List]]. You learn an additional emotion at level 5, 9, 13, 17, and 20.

Additionally, whenever you learn an emotion, you can choose one of the emotions you know and replace it with another emotion that you could learn at that level.

#### Emotional Usage and Effects

The effects of the emotions are specified in the [[Pot/Character Creation/Class & Subclasses/Empath Emotions List\|Empath Emotions List]]. These effects vary based on the result of all die spent in the use of a feature.

In order to use emotional effects in any capacity, you need to be able to speak or use your body in order to impart these emotions others. If you lose the ability to **move and speak** all your current **Emotional Effects** end.

Emotional Effects last as **up to 10 minutes** as along as you **maintain concentration** on them or until the targets succeed on a save:
- At the end of each turn, a creature affected by an **Emotional Effect** must succeed a Wisdom saving throw against your **Mote Save DC** to end the effect. Creatures can willingly fail this saving throw.

#### Limitations

Emotional effects only effect creatures that have emotions. Below are a list of common indicators for not capable of emotions:
- Creatures with **Intelligence 3 or less** usually indicate a lack of free will or complex thought.
- Creatures with Immunity to being **both frightened and charmed** usually indicate they are incapable of feeling emotion.

### Level 1: Emotional Envelopment

As a **bonus action**, you may touch a willing creature (including yourself) and expend any number **Mote Dice**. The target is immediately imbued with your an **Emotional Effect** of your choice. The strength of the effect is determined by the result of the Mote Die rolled, as described in  the [[Pot/Character Creation/Class & Subclasses/Empath Emotions List\|Empath Emotions List]].

This emotional effect lasts for **1 minute**, or until it is replaced by another use of this feature. A creature can only benefit from one Emotional Infusion at a time.

### Level 2: Manipulative Techniques

#### Projection

As an action, choose one creature within 60 feet of you that can see or hear you and is susceptible to your emotional effects. Additionally, you may expend any number of **Mote Dice** to choose an **Emotional Effect** (you don't have to expend any) to fuel this projection.

The target must make a **Wisdom or Charisma saving throw** (your choice) against your **Mote Save DC**. A creature may choose to automatically fail this saving throw.

- **On a failed save**, if you expended any **Mote Dice**, the target is affected by the selected **Emotional Effect**. The strength of the effect is determined by the result of the Mote Die rolled, as described in  the [[Pot/Character Creation/Class & Subclasses/Empath Emotions List\|Empath Emotions List]].
- If the target is an enemy and it fails the saving throw, it also takes **1d8 + the total of the expended Mote Dice** in psychic damage.
- If the target is an ally, it gains temporary hit points equal to the **expended Mote Dice** **total**.

#### Outburst

As an action, choose any number of creatures within a 10 feet radius of you that can see or hear you and are susceptible to your emotional effects. Additionally, you may expend any number of **Mote Dice** to choose an **Emotional Effect** (you don't have to expend any) to fuel this outburst.

The targets must make a **Wisdom or Charisma saving throw** (your choice) against your **Mote Save DC**. A creature may choose to automatically fail this saving throw.

- If you expended any **Mote Dice**, the targets which failed the saving throw are affected by the selected **Emotional Effect**. The strength of the effect is determined by the result of the Mote Die rolled, as described in  the [[Pot/Character Creation/Class & Subclasses/Empath Emotions List\|Empath Emotions List]].
- The enemy targets that failed the saving throw also takes **1d4 + the total of the expended Mote Dice** in psychic damage.
- If the target is an ally, it gains temporary hit points equal to the **expended Mote Dice** **total**.

#### Imbuement

As a **bonus action**, you can expend any number of **Mote Dice** to imbue a weapon (including unarmed strikes) or a handheld object with **Emotional Effect**. This effect lasts for **1 hour** or until you use this feature again.

While imbued, the next time the object or weapon **makes contact with a creature**—such as when you hit with a melee or ranged attack— you may release its emotional energy into that creature. The target must make a **Wisdom or Charisma saving throw** (your choice) against your **Mote Save DC**. A creature may choose to automatically fail this saving throw.

- On a **failed save**, the creature is affected by your current **Emotional Effect**, and you may have the creature take **additional psychic damage equal to the result of the expended Mote Dice**. The strength of the effect is determined by the result of the Mote Die rolled, as described in  the [[Pot/Character Creation/Class & Subclasses/Empath Emotions List\|Empath Emotions List]].
- On a **successful save**, only the normal attack damage applies.

The **Emotional Effect** is **expended** after the effect is released, hit or miss.

### Level 3: Signature Aspect

At 3rd level, you choose a complex emotional aspect unique to yourself. This aspect grants you control over a complicated emotion and grants you features at 3rd level, and again at 7th, 11th, 15th, and 18th level.

**Aspects:**
- [[Pot/Character Creation/Class & Subclasses/Warheart Empath\|the Warheart]] - Battle Prowess and honor


### Level 4: Ability Score Improvement

You gain the [Ability Score Improvement feat](http://dnd2024.wikidot.com/feat:ability-score-improvement) or another [feat of your choice](http://dnd2024.wikidot.com/feat:all) for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Empath levels 8, 12, and 16.

### Level 5: Situational Adaptation

You can use your **Mote ability modifier** in place of your normal ability modifier for **Insight**, **Persuasion**, **Intimidation**, and **Deception** checks. Additionally, among those skill that you are proficient in, you gain expertise, and among those you aren't, you gain proficiency.

### Level 6: Inflammatory Actions

While you are able to **speak**, you may choose to convert all **psychic damage** dealt by your Empath class features into **fire damage**. You can make this choice each time you deal damage with an Empath feature.

### Level 6: Chilling Words

While you are able to **move**, you may choose to convert all **psychic damage** dealt by your Empath class features into **ice damage**. You can make this choice each time you deal damage with an Empath feature.

### Level 9: Unreadable Veil

Creatures have **disadvantage on Insight checks** made to read your intentions or emotional state.

In addition, when a creature attempts to **read your mind or detect your thoughts** using magic (such as detect thoughts, zone of truth, or similar effects), it must succeed on a **Wisdom saving throw** against your **Mote Save DC**. On a failure, the spell or effect provides only vague, conflicting, or misleading emotional impressions, and the creature gains no meaningful insight.

### Level 10: Stoic Empowerment

When a creature within the range of your **Manipulative Technique: Projection** or **any number of creatures** within the range of your **Manipulative Technique: Outburst** is required to make a **saving throw against a mental or emotional effect** you can use your **reaction** to empower their will.
- Mental effects include effects like being **charmed**, **frightened**, or affected by a spell like vicious mockery.

To do so, expend any number of **Mote Die**. Each affected creature adds the **result of the Mote Dice** to their saving throw.

You can choose to use this feature **after the roll is made but before the result is determined**.

### Level 13: Multiplexities

You can maintain concentration on an additional **Emotion Effect**. You can maintain concentration on additional **Emotional Effect** when you reach 17th and then another when your reach 20th level.

When you lose concentration on one emotional effect, you lose concentration on all effects.

When you apply a new Emotional Effect and do not have enough capacity to concentrate on it, you end a different Emotional Effect of your choice.

### Level 14: Observational Insight

If you spend **1 hour observing and studying a creature** by watching their expressions, behavior, and emotional responses, you can attune yourself to their emotional rhythms. For the next **24 hours**, as long as the creature is within your sight and within range of your **Manipulative Technique: Projection**, you can sense their **surface thoughts** (what is currently on their mind) without requiring concentration or magical detection.

This awareness does not reveal deeper motives or hidden truths, but it allows you to subtly interpret their current focus, intent, or emotional state. Creatures affected by mind blank or similar magic are immune to this effect.

### Level 15: Improved Manipulative Techniques

The capabilities of your manipulative techniques increase:
- The range of your **Projection** technique increases to 120 foot.
- The range of your **Outburst** technique increases to a 15 foot radius.
- Whenever an object you're touching contacts another creature, you can use your **reaction** rather than your bonus action to active your **Imbuement** technique

### Level 19: Epic Boon

You gain an [Epic Boon feat](http://dnd2024.wikidot.com/feat:all) or another feat of your choice for which you qualify.
