As a Empath, you gain the following class features when you reach the specified Empath levels. These features are listed in the Empath Features table.

#### Level 1: Empath's Presence

*Your speech and actions carry heavy social weight. You can use this to influence those around you.*

As an action, each creature of your choice within 15 feet who can either see or hear you must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or be affected by emotional effect of your choice.
- **Saving Throw DC:**  8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier

If a target is **already under the effect** of an emotional state from this feature:
- **Enemies** instead take **1d6 psychic damage** per emotional state already applied. This effect's damage increases by 1d6 when you reach 5th level (2d6), 11th level (3d6), and 17th level (4d6).
- **Allies** instead gain **temporary hit points** equal to your Proficiency bonus.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your **Proficiency bonus** to apply a new emotion, and regain all expended uses on a **short rest**, but maintaining an emotional effect or applying the same effect to new people, does not count as a use of this feature.

##### Effect Potency

Whenever you apply, reapply, or maintain an emotional effect, you must make an **Emotional Potency Roll** by rolling a d20.  Different Empath features that cause emotional effects might add different values to the result of this **Emotional Potency Roll**. If the total is ever 20 or greater, magic is imbued into the emotional effect increasing its power and replacing the normal effect. If an effect is already applied to a creature, you take the highest result of any roll applied to them.

The result of your **Potency Roll** applies to all instances of creatures affected by it, not individual creatures. For example, if you are affecting all your Allies with enhanced excitement, an a NPC joins your radius, they are also affected by enhanced excitement.

Your DM may rule that any given creature affected by your emotional effect is predisposed to that emotion - such as having anger issues - or already influenced by a weaker version of that emotion - such as being depressed from the loss of a friend - and allow you advantage on your **Emotional Potency Roll**. 


##### Maintaining Emotional Effects

If a creature affected by an **Emotional Effect** is outside the radius of your presence, or you didn't use your action to maintain your currently applied effects, each affected creature can retry the saving throw for the effect at the end of their turn. On failure, the effect remains.

##### Improved Presence

**Additional Emotions:** At 1st level, you know 2 emotions from the [[Pot/Character Creation/Class & Subclasses/Empath/Empath Emotions List v2\|Empath Emotion List]]. You learn an additional emotion as shown in the Known Emotion column of the Empath Feature table (part B).
- Additionally, whenever you learn an emotion, you can choose one of the emotions you know and replace it with another emotion that you could learn at that level.

**Emotional Specialization:** When you would learn a new emotion, except at 1st level, you can instead specialize in another emotion you already know. When you do this, that emotions enhanced effect can be triggered on a result totaling 15 or more rather than 20 or more.

##### Limitations

Emotional effects only effect creatures that have emotions. Below are a list of common indicators that a creature is not capable of emotions or complex though:
- Intelligence 3 or less.
- Immunity to being both frightened and charmed.
- Immunity to Psychic damage.

#### Level 1: Insightful Learner

_You can temporarily learn from the talents of others with remarkable precision._

After you observe a creature using a skill, tool, weapon, or armor, you can choose to gain proficiency in that skill or tool until your next long rest. If the skill or tool is one you're already proficient with, you instead gain **Expertise** (double your proficiency bonus) with it. You gain these skills by either:
- Spending 30 minutes observing a creature using that skill, tool, weapon, or armor.
- Witnessing a creature successfully use that skill, tool, weapon, or armor and successfully making a DC 15 Insight (Wisdom) ability check as a **reaction**.

You can temporary learn a number of proficiencies or expertises at once equal to your **proficiency bonus**, and these choices last until you finish a long rest. If you exceed this limit, you must choose one of your current adaptations to forget.

#### Level 2: Deep Bonds

You can take the help action as a bonus action. When you would use it to give advantage to an ally's attack, you may do it if they can be affected by your Empath's Presence.

#### Level 3: Empath subclass

You gain a Empath subclass of your choice. A subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Empath levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclassâ€™s features that are of your Monk level or lower.

**Aspects:**
- the General - combat leader, apply effects with attacks
	- manipulative technique: on damaging enemies
- the Mentor - guide, apply effects with help action
	- manipulative technique: one person at a distance strong
- the Leech - lurker in the shadows, apply effects secretly
	- directly on one person, but they don't know
- the Siren - center of attention, applies effects to people that can see them
	- manipulative technique: large weak area of effect
	- fighting styles: distraction and mariner

#### Level 4: Ability Score Improvement

You gain the [Ability Score Improvement feat](http://dnd2024.wikidot.com/feat:ability-score-improvement) or another [feat of your choice](http://dnd2024.wikidot.com/feat:all) for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Empath levels 8, 12, and 16.

#### Level 19: Epic Boon

You gain an [Epic Boon feat](http://dnd2024.wikidot.com/feat:all) or another feat of your choice for which you qualify.
