# Conduit: Leyline of Knowledge


## Level 3: Sage Transformation

When you would enter your **Conduit Form**, you may enter an alternate version of it called **Sage Form**. This state has all the same effects of your **Conduit Form** as well as providing you with following:
- You have advantage on all Intelligence checks and saving throws, and disadvantage on all Charisma checks and saving throws. 
- All damage from your weapon attacks becomes force damage, and all damage dealt by your weapon attacks and Conduit features is non-lethal.

## Level 3: Recall of the Elders

You can spend 10 minutes in focused meditation to recall any moment you have personally experienced, as if reliving it with vivid detail. During this meditation, you may:

- Perfectly remember everything you perceived during the event, including exact words, sounds, visuals, and emotional impressions, as long as you were conscious at the time.
- Choose to remake one ability check related to the memory, such as **Perception**, **Insight**, or **Investigation**, using your current ability scores and proficiencies. This represents a deeper analysis with the benefit of hindsight and magical focus.    

You can use this feature **once per short or long rest**, unless you expend a **Channeling Point** to use it again.


### Level 7: Transcendence

When you would enter an **Overdrive** state, you may instead enter an alternate version of it called **Transcendent** state of the same degree. The DC of the Constitution saving throw to maintain the form stays the same and 

When you would enter your **Overdrive** state, you may enter an alternate version of it called **Transcendent** state. This state has all the same effects of your **Overdrive** Form as well as providing you with following:
- You have advantage on all Intelligence checks and saving throws, and disadvantage on all Charisma checks and saving throws. 
- All damage from your weapon attacks becomes force damage, and all damage dealt by your weapon attacks and Conduit features is non-lethal.
- When you fail your Constitution saving throw to maintain your **Transcendent** state, you may decide to continue to maintain it instead. Regardless, when you fail it, you mind wanders to deeply, and you can no longer take bonus actions or reactions until the end of your next turn.

While in your **Transcendent** state, as an action you can focus your senses on one creature you can see within 60 feet of you. If the target is not incapacitated or behind total cover, you instantly glean critical details about its capabilities. You learn the two of the following about the creature in any combination (you may select the same one twice):
- Its armor class
- Its current hit points and temporary hit points
- Its damage resistances, immunities, and vulnerabilities
- The name and effect of one of its features or actions (your choice: offensive, defensive, or movement-related) that has not already been named this way
- An ability score of your choice and its proficiency bonus

### Level 11: Collapse of Possibility

When you or a creature you can see makes a d20 roll (attack roll, ability check, or saving throw), you can replace the roll with a **10**. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your **Intelligence modifier** (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a **long rest**.

You must declare the use of this feature **before** the result of the roll is known.

### Level 15: Controlled Destiny

Once per long rest, rather than replacing a roll with 10 using Collapse of Possibility, you may instead replace it with a 5 or 15.
