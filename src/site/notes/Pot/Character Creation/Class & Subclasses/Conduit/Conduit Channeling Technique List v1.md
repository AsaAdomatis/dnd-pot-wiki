# Channeling Techniques

### Pulse

As an attack, you may expend a number of Channeling Points (at least 1) to release a pulsing wave of energy around you. Each creature within 10 feet of you must make a Strength Saving Throw. A creature takes 1d4 force damage for each Channeling Point you expended as is pushed 5 feet away from your on a failed save, and half as much damage and isn't pushed back on a successful one.

***At higher levels.*** This damage increases to 1d6 per point at 5th level, 1d8 per point at 11th level, and 1d10 per point at 17th level.

### Sacrifice

As an action, you may expend all of your remaining Channeling Points to unleash a catastrophic pulse of energy. When you do, you die instantly as you body disintegrates from the force.

Each creature of your choice within 45 feet of you must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d10 force damage for each Channeling Point expended, or half as much on a successful save. This damage ignores resistance and cannot be reduced or avoided by evasion, reactions, or immunities.

Objects and structures in the area automatically take maximum damage.

Once you use this feature, you cannot be revived except by a **wish**, **true resurrection**, or other divine intervention.

**Prerequisite:** Level 8+ Conduit, Pulse Channeling Technique

### Blast

As an attack, you may expend a number of Channeling Points, at least 1, to release a blast of energy. Make a channeling attack against a target 60 feet away. On a hit the target takes 1d8 force damage for each channeling point expended and must make a Strength saving throw. On failure, it is pushed 10 feet away from you.

**_At Higher Levels._** The technique creates more than one blast when you reach higher levels: two blasts at 5th level, three blasts at 11th level, and four blasts at 17th level. You can direct the blasts at the same target or at different ones. Make a separate attack roll for each beam.

### Barrage

As an attack, you may expend a number of Channeling Points, at least 1, to release a barrage of energy blasts. Choose a point you can see within 60 feet of you. Each creature within 5 feet of that point must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 1d6 force damage per Channeling Point expended. 

***At higher levels.*** This damage increases to 1d8 per point at 5th level, 1d10 per point at 11th level, and 1d12 per point at 17th level.

### Blind

As an action, you may expend 2 Channeling Points to unleash a flash of searing magical energy in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in the area must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature is blinded until the end of its next turn. On a successful save, the creature is unaffected.

### Bolt
You can spend a number Channeling Points to take two of any combination of the Dodge, Dash and Disengage actions as an action on your turn. When you do, your movement speed increase by 5 feet for each Channeling Point expended until the end of the turn.

### Smoke Veil

When you're struck by an attack after already being damaged this round, you expend a Channeling Point and use your reaction to kick up mist and dust around yourself, shrouding yourself in a dense fog. A 20-foot-radius sphere of fog centered on you spreads out and heavily obscures the area. The effect mimics the fog cloud spell, but:
- It does not require concentration.
- The effect immediately ends if you move or make an attack, or cast another spell.

While the fog persists, you are hidden from view, evoking the mysterious stillness before the smoke clears.

### Fly

As a bonus action, you can expend 1 Channeling Point to gain a flying speed equal to your movement speed until the start of your next turn. If you use this Channeling technique sequentially, there is no down time between flying, and you do not fall out of the sky.

**Prerequisite:** Level 8+ Conduit

### Blink

When you **hit a creature with a thrown weapon attack**, you can expend **2 Channeling Points** to teleport to an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the target. You must be able to see the target and have a clear path to the space.

This teleportation does not provoke opportunity attacks. If no such space exists, the Channeling Points are not expended.
