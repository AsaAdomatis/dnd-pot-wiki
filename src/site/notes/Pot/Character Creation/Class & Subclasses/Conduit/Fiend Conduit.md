# Conduit: Leyline of the Royalty

**Author's Note:** This subclass is designed to evoke the idea of the conduit channeling energy from another plane by being royalty or the avatar of that plane. Hence, it's bit complicated and offers variants for channeling from the Lower Planes (fiends), the Upper Planes (celestial), or the Feywild (fey).

**Variant:** When you adopt this subclass, you must choose a variant representing the planes through which you channel energy: Upper Planes (Celestial), Lower Planes (Fiends), Feywild (Fey)

## Level 3: Royal Transformation

When you would enter your **Conduit Form**, you may enter an alternate version of it called **Royal Form**. This state has all the same effects of your **Conduit Form** as well as providing you with following:
- You have advantage on all Charisma checks and saving throws, and disadvantage on all Wisdom checks and saving throws. 
- All damage from your weapon attacks and all force damage from Conduit features becomes necrotic damage for fiends, radiant damage for celestials, and psychic damage for fey.

**Appearance:** While in your Royal Form, you appearance changes to represent the transformation. With the Upper Planes, your eyes might grow or you might be adorned with a halo. With the Lower Planes, you might grow horns, a spiked tail, or have your eyes become fiendish red. With the Fey Wild, you ears might grow long, or your skin might sparkle. After you transform for the first time, the changes linger in a minor, subdued way in your normal state.

## Level 3: Wagers
**Variant:** Fey, Fiend

You gain the ability to offer wager to others that magically bind the participants to some consequence. You have the following consequences available to you:
- **Dominance:** For the next hour, the loser of the wager must obey all commands of the wager's winner to the best of the ability. These commands cannot put the loser in any immediate or direct danger or cause them to harm themselves.
	- ex: Dance; flirt with the dragon; attack a friend; but not hold this lit alchemist fire or take this arrow to the knee.
- **Power:** For the next hour, the loser of the wager reduces all their d20 rolls by half their proficiency bonus (rounded down) and the winner increases all their d20 rolls by half their amount.

These wagers usually take the form of some contest, common wagers are listed below and usually take an action to complete:
- Arm Wrestling - An Athletic Contest
- Game of Dragon Chess - An Intelligence Contest
- Coin Flip - Luck Contest

**Caveats:** When you offer a wager to another, they must willingly except the bet without magical encouragement or coercion or any major threat to themselves or others they care about. Additionally, the wager must be relatively, only favoring a participant who has greater skill. 

Once a wager is accepted, you cannot offer another wager until you finish a short or long rest.

### Level 3: Edicts

**Variant:** Celestial, Fey (Must Choose Edicts or Wagers)

You gain the ability to offer celestial edicts to others. The edict is a task they must willing choose to accept, that when completed offers a boon, and when failed offers negative consequences.

- **Edict of Truth:** The target must speak only the truth, as they understand and  without omission, for 10 minutes. 
	- **On successful completion**, they gain advantage on Insight and Persuasion checks for the duration and are immune to being magically deceived by illusions or otherwise.
	- **On failure to complete**, the target aura dims with treachery and falsehood. They cannot benefit from effects provided by their allies (e.g. bardic inspiration, guidance, pact tactics) for 1 hour.
- **Edict of Compassion:** The target must spare a foe of your choice, by allowing the foe to flee, be stabilized, or by the accepter preventing the death of the target:
	- **On successful completion**, you and the target gain temporary hit points equal to your Conduit level.
	- **On failure to complete**, the target cannot regain hit points, loses all temporary hit points, and cannot gain temporary hit points for the duration.

Once an edict is accepted, you cannot offer another edict until you finish a short or long rest.

### Level 7: Imperium State

When you would enter an **Overdrive** state, you may instead enter an alternate version of it called **Imperium** state of the same degree. The DC of the Constitution saving throw to maintain the form stays the same and 

When you would enter your **Overdrive** state, you may enter an alternate version of it called **Imperium** state. This state has all the same effects of your **Overdrive** Form as well as providing you with following:
- You have advantage on all Charisma checks and saving throws, and disadvantage on all Wisdom checks and saving throws. 
- All damage from your weapon attacks and all force damage from Conduit features becomes necrotic damage for fiends, radiant damage for celestials, and psychic damage for fey.
- When you enter your Overdrive state, you summon a number of minions of your choice whose total CR is equal to the degree of your **Imperium** state.
	- Minions are fiends, celestials and fey based on your inheritance.
	- Some creature types (celestials) don't have standard creatures that make perfect use of the CR limit, so here's a standard CR 1/4 minion that can be used to fill in the gaps: [[Monsters/Planar Minion\|Planar Minion]]
- When you fail your Constitution saving throw to maintain your **Imperium** state, you may decide to continue it instead.

Your minions obey your commands as best as they can while you control them. They take their turns immediately after yours in initiative order. On your turn, as an action, you can verbally command your fiends what to do. If you donâ€™t issue a command, the minions takes the Dodge action. Using the Extra Attack feature, you can make one weapon attack yourself when you command your minions.

However, your minions are only bound to you when you can control them. When you fail the Constitution saving throw to maintain your **Imperium** state, on their next turn, you minions ignore all of their orders and turn on you and your allies to the best of their capability (The DM controls them during this turn).


### Level 11: Ancestral Flight

You gain the ability to sprout a pair of wings from your back, gaining a flying speed of 60 feet. You can create these wings as an action on your turn. They last for 10 minutes or until you dismiss them as a bonus action on your turn.

You can't manifest your wings while wearing armor unless the armor is made to accommodate them, and clothing not made to accommodate your wings might be destroyed when you manifest them.

You can use this feature once per long or short rest for free, but each each additional usage requires you to expend 4 Channeling Points.

### Level 11: Ancestral Steed (Optional

This feature replaces the Ancestral Flight feature. 

Once per short or long rest, you can cast [Find Steed](http://dnd2024.wikidot.com/spell:find-steed) at 3rd level with a creature type according to your planar origin. You ignore the somatic component while casting it this way.

You can activate this feature additional times per rest by expending 4 Channeling Points.

### Level 15: Planar Travel

Once per long rest, you can cast [banishment](https://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:banishment) ignoring its material and somatic components. You may cast it additional times beyond the first per long rest, but each cost 5 Channeling points.

Additionally, once per long rest, you can spend 1 hour channeling eldritch or planar energy to tear open a temporary portal to a plane in which you draw you power or back to the material plane if you are in that plane.

At the end of the hour, a shimmering planar rift opens in an unoccupied space you can see within 10 feet of you. The rift forms a circular portal up to 10 feet in diameter, suspended vertically and hovering a few inches above the ground.
- The portal leads to a fixed location of your choice on that Origin Plane or Material Plane that you are familiar with or can clearly envision.
- The portal lasts for 1 minute or until you end it early as a bonus action.
- Any creature that enters the portal is transported to the destination plane.
