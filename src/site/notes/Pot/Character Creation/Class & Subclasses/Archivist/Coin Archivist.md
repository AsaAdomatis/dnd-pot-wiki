### Level 3: Flip of Fortune

As a bonus action, you may enchant a gold coin in your hand with magical fortune telling powers. The coin may flip it as a bonus action expending one of its charges. On heads, the next attack, ability check, or saving throw they make with advantage. On tails, they make it with disadvantage.
- The holder of the coin immediately know its enchanted and knows something is to be gained or loss when its flipped.
- The holder may dismiss the disadvantage provided by the flip by using an action.

The coin has a number of charges equal to your proficiency bonus and once you enchant a coin you can't again until you finish a long rest.

### Level 7: Coin Shot

You gain the ability to fire coins from your collection with surprising force. As an action, you can make a ranged spell attack against a creature within 120 feet of you. On a hit, the target takes force damage based on the quality of coin. Hit or miss, the coin bounces off a surface hitting another target within 60 feet of the original. You must make a separate attack roll for the other target.


| Coin     | Damage                             |
| -------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Copper   | 1d6  + your intelligence modifier  |
| Silver   | 1d8  + your intelligence modifier  |
| Gold     | 1d10  + your intelligence modifier |
| Platinum | 1d12 + your intelligence modifier  |

**At Higher Levels.** The coins bounces additional times hitting more targets with each bounce. At 11th level, it bounces two times passed the original target, and three times at 17th level. You must make a separate attack roll for the other targets.

### Level 11: Force the Hand

As a reaction, when you would make an attack, ability check, or saving throw, you may instead flip a coin, succeeding the check on heads, failing it on a tails.

Once you've used this feature, you can't use it till you've finished a short or long rest.

### Level 15: Improved Enchantment

You improve the quality of the enchantment you can place on coins. When another creature touches the coin, you may have them make a Wisdom saving throw against your Spell Save DC. If they fail, for as long as they hold the coin and it has charges, they are charmed by you, they are compelled to continue to hold the coin, and they must use their bonus action to flip the coin.

Additionally, rather than just enchanting one coin, you have a pool of charges you can distribute to each coin rather than a strict amount once per long rest. The pool of charges is equal to twice your proficiency bonus, and when you would enchant a coin, you may put any number of charges from your pool into that coin. The pool of charges you have resets after you finish a long rest.
