# Archivist: Favor of the Botanist

To an Herbalist, every leaf has a legacy, every root a secret. You travel the wild paths of the world not just as a collector, but as a caretaker—cataloging rare herbs, potent fungi, enchanted blossoms, and mythic seeds. These plants are more than specimens: they are magic made manifest, and you have trained your eye and hand to harvest and preserve their power.

Through study and instinct, you’ve learned to identify flora imbued with curative, protective, and even reality-warping properties. You prepare these samples as arcane reagents, infuse their energy into barklike armor, and call upon their latent spirits for aid. Where others see a forest, you see a living archive.

Herbalists often travel lightly, their satchels full of pressed petals, pungent roots, and glowing mosses. Your presence brings renewal to allies and entangling consequences to your enemies—one seed at a time.

### Level 3: Arboreal Spells

You learn additional spells when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown on the table below. Each of these spells counts as an archivist spell for you, but it doesn't count against the number of archivist spells you know.

### Level 3: Bark Armor

You’ve learned to magically empower the flora in your collection, transforming it into potent, protective armor. Once per short or long rest, you can enchant a sample of flora from your archive. As an action, you or a creature in possession of the sample can consume it to cause thick, vine-ridden bark to grow and encase the body. This armor lasts for 1 minute, until it is shattered (see below), or until the wearer is incapacitated. While the armor is active, the wearer gains the following benefits:

- **Natural Defense.** The wearer has resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, slashing, lightning, and poison damage. They also have advantage on saving throws against the poisoned condition and disease.
- **False Appearance.** While motionless and in natural terrain, the wearer is indistinguishable from the surrounding plant life.
- **Rootlash Retaliation.** When a creature deals damage to the wearer, the wearer can use their reaction to cause roots and vines to lash out from beneath the attacker. The creature must succeed on a Strength saving throw (DC = 10 + your proficiency bonus) or have its speed reduced to 0 and be unable to take reactions until the start of its next turn.
- **Shattered Armor.** If the wearer take damage from a single source that equals or exceeds four times your Archivist level, the armor shatters immediately, and they instead take no damage from that instance.


### Level 7: Timberguard Shelter

When a creature you can see within 60 feet of you drops to 0 hit points, you can use your reaction to preserve their life by magically encasing them in a living tree. That creature instead drops to 1 hit point and is immediately enveloped by a magically grown tree trunk. While inside the tree, the creature gains the following benefits:

- The creature is petrified while encased but remains conscious and aware of its surroundings. While petrified in this way, the creature is conscious and aware of its surroundings but cannot move or act.
- The creature is charmed by you for the duration and can communicate with you telepathically as long as you are on the same plane of existence.
- The tree has AC 15 and 50 hit points. It is a magical object immune to poison and psychic damage and vulnerable to fire damage. If the tree is reduced to 0 hit points, it splits open, ending the effect immediately.
- You can end this effect early as a bonus action. Once a creature emerges from the tree, willingly or otherwise, the effect ends and the tree withers away.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Level 11: Arboreal Adventurer

Moving through nonmagical difficult terrain caused by plants, fungi, or other natural life costs you costs no extra movement. You can also pass through nonmagical plants without being slowed by them and without taking damage from them if they have thorns, spines, or a similar hazard.

In addition, you have advantage on saving throws against plants that are magically created or manipulated to impede movement, such as those created by the [Entangle](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:entangle) spell.

### Level 14: Restorative Shelter

As a bonus action, you can expend any number of dice from your **Magical Archive** to have any number of creatures in your Timberguard Shelter regain hit points (the result + your proficiency bonus + your intelligence modifier)

### ### Level 18: Improved Empowerment

When you use empower a sample of flora in your collection via the Bark Armor feature, you can empower an additional 3 samples.
