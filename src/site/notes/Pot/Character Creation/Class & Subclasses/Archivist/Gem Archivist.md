### Level 3: Crystalline Spells

You learn additional spells when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown on the table below. Each of these spells counts as an archivist spell for you, but it doesn't count against the number of archivist spells you know.

### Level 3: Mystic Reservoir

When you restore hit points to a creature and it would be healed beyond its hit point maximum, you can store the excess healing in one of your crystals.

You can store a total amount of healing equal to your Intelligence modifier × your proficiency bonus (minimum of 1). When you cast a spell that restores hit points, you can add any amount of stored healing to that spell’s total.

Stored healing lasts until you finish a long rest.

### Level 7: Meditative Rest

You gain the ability to guide your party in meditative rest powered by your rare gems and crystals. When you finish a long rest, instead of losing all stored healing, each creature who long rested with you, including yourself, gains temporary hit points equal to either of the following: 
- Half your stored hit points rounded up.
- Your Archivist level.

### Level 11: Elemental Reservoir

Your mastery of enchanted crystals allows you to redirect destructive energy into reservoirs of vitality. When you or an ally within 30 feet takes acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage, you can use your reaction to absorb some of the energy into one of your infused gems.

When you do, reduce the triggering damage by an amount equal to your Archivist level + your Intelligence modifier. The damage prevented in this way is stored as hit points like detailed in the Mystic Reservoir feature.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus per long rest.

### Level 18: Last Resort

You've learned to project the mystical power stored within your crystal to subdued you enemies and save your allies. As a bonus action, you may expend all of your stored hit points. For each creature within 30 feet of you, choose 1 of the following:
- Deal force damage to that creature equal to the number of hit points expended. This damage is non-lethal.
- Heal that creature a number of hit points equal to the expended amount, but do no store any additional hit points for healing them beyond their maximum.
