# Archivist

**Author's Note.** 
- *Complexity - High:* The archivist is a complex class, not for in depth mechanics, but rather it requires you to maintain a large pool of many varied dice that doesn't refill in any standard capacity. Excellent ledger skills are required.
- *Playstyle - Modified Spellcaster:* The Archivist is primarily as spellcaster with a minor twist. It has no cantrips and is focused on casting powerful level 1 spells.

Archivists are meticulous seekers of knowledge and relics, driven by an insatiable curiosity to discover, collect, and preserve items of power and significance. Whether ancient artifacts, obscure trinkets, or forgotten tools, each object tells a story—and the Archivist’s mission is to uncover it. Guided by keen intellect and disciplined perception, Archivists examine objects with precision, discerning their origins, secrets, and potential. Their training refines both eye and instinct, enabling them to detect items others overlook and draw out dormant magic hidden within.

Each Archivist carries a **Portable Archive**, a curated extradimensional collection of objects gathered across their journeys. Through deep study and arcane technique, they unlock unique magical effects stored in their collection, wielding spells and abilities that reflect the knowledge encoded in their gathered treasures. Every Archivist chases a personal legend: the discovery of the _ideal object_, the one perfect addition that will complete their life's work—until, of course, they realize the collection is never truly complete.

As a Archivist, you gain the following class features when you reach the specified Archivist levels. These features are listed in the Archivist Features table.

### Level 1: Spellcasting

As an archiver of the rarest magical objects, you can access the power within them and unleash their magic through spells. The information below details how you use those rules with Archivist spells, which appear in the [[Pot/Character Creation/Class & Subclasses/Archivist/Archivist Spell List v1\|Archivist Spell List]] later in the class's description

**Spell Slots.** The Archivist Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a Long Rest.

**Prepared Spells of Level 1+.** You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose four level 1 Archivist spells. [[Pot/Spells/Arcane Burst\|Arcane Burst]], [[Pot/Spells/Ward\|Ward]], [Mage Armor](https://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:mage-armor), and [Alarm](https://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:alarm) are recommended.

The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Archivist levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Archivist Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional Archivist spells until the number of spells on your list matches the number in the Archivist Features table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you’re a level 3 Archivist, your list of prepared spells can include six Archivist spells of level 1 or 2 in any combination.

If another Archivist feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don’t count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Sorcerer spells for you.

**Changing Your Prepared Spells.** Whenever you gain a Archivist level, you can replace one spell on your list with another Sorcerer spell for which you have spell slots.

**Spellcasting Ability.** Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your Archivist spells.

**Spellcasting Focus.** You can use your Portable Archive or the items in it as a Spellcasting Focus for your Archivist spells.

### Level 1: Cherished Item

You choose an item you own, or a new item you find to become a cherished part of your archive. This item can be a weapon, a piece of equipment, a tool, or another object. You can use your intelligence modifier for checks and bonus involved in the use of that item. Further, you become proficient in that item or in the skill related to it. Options follow:
- **Weapon:** Intelligence instead for attacks and damage, proficiency in that weapon.
- **Tool:** Intelligence for checks with that tool, proficiency in that tool.
- **Armor:** Intelligence rather than dexterity for increasing AC, proficiency in that armor.
- **Misc. Item:** Choose a skill of your choice represented by the cherished item you chose. You use intelligence for the skill, and gain proficiency in that skill while you have the item.
	- Ex: A embroidered cloak: proficiency in stealth, use intelligence mod. rather than dex.

You discover additional cherished items at higher levels as show in the Archivist features table.

### Level 2: Portable Archive

You possess a Portable Archive, a magical container similar in properties to a _bag of holding_, with the following differences:

- It stores all your Magical Archive dice (see below) without using up normal storage space.
- Sentient creatures can’t be stored inside, except for yourself and any familiars.
- The contents aren't lost if the archive is destroyed. If you create a new archive through your feature, its contents are restored.
- If destroyed, you can recreate it by spending 1 hour and 50 gp to bind a suitable vessel as the new archive.
- The archive has AC equal to your spell save DC, HP equal to your Archivist level + your proficiency bonus, and is immune to poison and psychic damage.

You determine the archive’s external appearance and its internal aesthetic, which may resemble a cluttered study, crystalline display vault, or cataloged library.

**Magical Archive and Spell Slots.** In addition to your spell slots, you have a pool of dice called your **Magical Archive** which you can expend dice from to generate spell slots and cast level 1 spells. Each dice in the pool represents an item in your collection with its potential currently untapped.
- **Collection Size.** The total number of dice you can store is expressed as a total number of die faces. Refer to the Archivist table for your Collection Size.
- **Passive Archiving.** When you finish a long rest, you regain a number of dice equal to half your Collection Size in faces (e.g., a d6 and d4 = 10 faces).
- **Active Archiving.** At the DM’s discretion, you may discover additional dice representing rare items during exploration or through story events.. The rarity of dice is listed below:

| Dice | Rarity    | Gold Equivalent | **General Spell Level Equivalency**                     |
| ---- | --------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| d4   | Common    | 50gp            | 1                                                       |
| d6   | Common    | 75gp            | 2                                                       |
| d8   | Uncommon  | 100gp           | 3                                                       |
| d10  | Uncommon  | 350gp           | 4                                                       |
| d12  | Rare      | 500gp           | 5                                                       |
| d20  | Very Rare | 5,000gp         | 9                                                       |
| d100 | Very Rare | 7,500gp         | 9 (extremely low variance, but takes up too much space) |

**Casting Spells from the Archive.** To cast a 1st-level spell you have prepared, you may expend one die from your archive and roll it. Add your Intelligence modifier to the result. This is called a **Potency Check**. Consult the table below to determine the level of spell slot generated, which is immediately used to cast the selected 1st-level spell. 

| Result | Level of Spell Slot Generated |
| ------ | ----------------------------- |
| 1-5    | 1                             |
| 6-7    | 2                             |
| 8-9    | 3                             |

**Entering the Archive.** You may also enter your Portable Archive to examine your collection

- As an **action**, you and any familiars within 5 feet magically teleport into your Portable Sanctuary, a 20-foot-radius, 20-foot-high chamber whose design reflects your collection and tastes.
- You may remain in the sanctuary for a number of hours equal to twice your proficiency bonus. You may exit early as a **bonus action**. If you die or the archive is destroyed, the sanctuary collapses and you are ejected to the nearest unoccupied space.
- Your familiars may enter or exit the sanctuary on their own using an action.
- Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.

### Level 3: Favored Objects

You gain a Archivist subclass of your choice. A subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Archivist levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass’s features that are of your Archivist level or lower.

Additionally, when you cast an Archivist spell, if the familiar is within 5 feet of you, it can forgo its action on its next turn to choose another die in your collection (dice pool) and expend it adding the result to your **Potency Check.**

You gain additional familiars (ignoring the limit detailed in the spell) as you level up as list in the Archivist Features table.

### Level 10: Portable Sanctuary

When you enter your Magical Archive via the Portable Archive feature, you can now choose up to five willing creatures that you can see within 30 feet of you, and the chosen creatures are drawn into the vessel with you.

As a bonus action, you can eject any number of creatures from the vessel, and everyone is ejected if you leave or die or if the vessel is destroyed.

In addition, anyone (including you) who remains within the archive for at least 4 hours gains the benefit of finishing a long rest. When they do, they can add your Intelligence modifier to the any ability check or saving throw once before they finish another long rest. When you do, you can add your proficiency bonus to one of your **Potency Checks** once before you finish another long rest.
