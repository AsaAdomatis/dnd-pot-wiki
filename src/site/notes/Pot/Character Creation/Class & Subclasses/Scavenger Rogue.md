#class #rogue #subclass #untested

<- [[Pot/Character Creation/Class & Subclasses/Class & Subclass Index\|Class & Subclass Index]]

The skillset of a rogue lines up quite nicely with that of the scavenger, a daring adventurer searching through ancient ruins for great treasure of old. Scavengers have the skills to survive these ancient and arcane ruins and the skills to sell what's inside them.

## Level 3: Scavenger Origin
_Every scavenger has an origin, an ancient ruin in which they honed their skills. In the Kingdom of Pot, four primary ruins exists: The [[Pot/Locations/Abyssal City\|Abyssal City]], an ancient spiraling citadel deep under the Bay of Pot; [[Pot/Locations/Plastic City\|The Plastic City]], an expansive walled city atop a cliff over [[Pot/Locations/Shoe\|Shoe]]; The [[Forest of Giant Things\|Forest of Giant Things]], an mythical forest of towering flora and fauna; and finally, the [[Mines of Mountmouth\|Mines of Mountmouth]], a prehistoric complex of mines and town built by ancient dwarves. Each ruin lends itself to a specific skillset._

At 3rd level, you select one of the following origins and gain features based on that origin:
- **_The Plastic City:_**
	- **Illusion Sight:** _The rooms of the City are always playing tricks on you. By now you know better._ You have advantage on Wisdom saving throws and Perception (WIS) checks to perceive through illusions.
	- **Daylight Mad Dash:** _Every day at dawn, the scavengers of Shoe line up to be the first to enter the freshly changed city. To succeed, you need speed._ You walking speed increase by 5 ft.
	- **Labyrinth Mind:** _The complex maze of everchanging rooms requires a special mind to navigate it._ You have advantage on Survival (Wisdom) or Investigation (INT) checks for find out your current location and/or any location you've been.

	- **Sky Diver:** _To get the speed you need to plunge into the abyss, you've learned to jump from thousands of feet up from the flying city of [[Pot/Locations/Fofam\|Fofam]]._ You take no falling damage, and you can always land on your feet when you fall. When you fall within melee range of another creature, you may use your reaction to deal damage to that creature equal to the fall damage you would've taken if you didn't have this feature.

- ***The Forest of Giant Things:***
	- **Climber:** You have a climb speed equal to your walking speed.
	- **Natural:** You are proficient in Nature.
	- **Giant Speaker:** Through sound and gestures, you can communicate simple ideas to medium or larger beasts.

		- If you already have darkvision or better, its range increases by 60ft.

## Level 3: Expert Improviser

## Level 9: Loot Sense
*The goal of every scavenger is to profit, and in order to profit, you need to know what's profitable. Your trained eyes can see the glimmer of riches, and your trained nose can sniff them out.*

At 9th level, you gain the ability to inherently detect loot:
- Items of worth (>1sp) have a glimmering aura detectable to you:
	- Within 120 ft., any item of worth (>1gp) that you can see has a glimmering aura to it only you can see.
	- Within 60 ft., any item of of worth (>1gp) regardless of if you can see it, produces an glimmering aura of greater intensity that can locate that item within a 10 ft. radius sphere (not exactly the in the center). Within 15 ft., the spheres radius decreases to 5 ft.

		- >50,000 (legendary magic item): shimmering pink and cyan
- You know the exact price (within reasonability or $\pm 10\%$) of any item you can touch.

## Level 9: Haggle Sense
*To be a successful scavenger, you also need to be a successful merchant.*

At 9th level, you gain the ability to haggle extremely well manifested in the following features:
- You always know where to sell an item or know how to find out how. If you don't know where to sell an item already, you may spend 2 hours gathering source to discover where you could sell an item.
- You gain advantage on all checks (CHA Intimidation/Persuasion) to increase the selling price of your item or decrease the buying price of an item. You may also add double your proficiency score to the result (If you are already proficient, you only add it once. If you have expertise in those skills, add nothing).
	- (Optional) At your DM's discretion, you may instead discount all items by 20% when purchasing items and increase the selling price of all items sold by this character by 20%.

## Level 13:  Arcane Safeguard
*Your exposure to the ancient and arcane ruins of your scavenging origin has left a mark on your soul, but also made it stronger.*

Starting at 13 level, **once per short or long rest**, when you are subjected to a spell or magical effect that requires you to make a saving throw, you can choose to **automatically succeed** instead.

You must use this feature before rolling the saving throw.

## Level 17: Deadly Improviser
*Your flexibility and adaptability required for scavenging has reached its apex. You can use your surroundings better than any weapon*
