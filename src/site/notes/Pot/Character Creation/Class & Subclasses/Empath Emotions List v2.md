# Empath Emotion List

## Mechanics
Whenever a number of creatures is effected by an Emotional Effect, make a **Mote Effect Roll** by rolling a d20.  Different Empath features that cause emotional effects might add different values to the result of this **Mote Effect Role**. If the total is ever 20 or greater, magic is imbued into the emotional effect increasing its power and replacing the normal effect. 

Your DM may rule that any given creature affected by your emotional effect is predisposed to that emotion - such as having anger issues - or already influenced by a weaker version of that emotion - such as being depressed from the loss of a friend - and allow you advantage on your **Mote Effect Roll**.
