# Welcome to the Kingdom of Pot Setting

The Kingdom of Pot and the greater continent of Pan is a campaign setting designed around whimsy. Its inspiration is primarily taken from Adventure Time and Studio Ghibli. This manifests in themes of regrowth and reconstruction. The major cities of Pan are built upon the ruins of prehistoric civilizations and the magic of the world is weak and untapped.

## Peoples

Listed below are brief descriptions of the peoples of [[Pot/Locations/Pan, the Greater Realm\|Pan]]. If they have a particularly interesting or adapted culture and placement, there will also be a page for them.

### Dragonborn

The main strong hold of the Dragon born is the South in [[Nailia\|Nailia]] and [[Goldpan\|Goldpan]]. They are most for living in the desert city Blue and inheriting that same color and the swamp city of [[Muk\|Muk]] amongst the tar dwarves. These tar Dragonborns are usually green and black. While every color appears in a scatter form across the lands of Umm, some particularly odd steely silver ones can be found in the scavenging city of [[Pot/Locations/Shoe\|Shoe]].

### Dwarves

[[Dwarves of Pot\|Dwarves]] have three primary homes, the winding mountain range of [[Stonton\|Stonton]] as the whistle of the wind and the song of the steel, the north of [[Trawlittle\|Trawlittle]] as seafarers and ice tamers, and in the far South as frontiersman and mud divers.

### Elves

[[Elves of Pot\|Elves]] came to the island of Pan and the all-lands of [[Umm\|Umm]] first long ago by leaving their home in Faery and traversing the [[Astral Sea\|Astral Sea]]. This first wave of migrants landed in [[Pot/Locations/Elvilae\|Elvilae]] with part of the Goblinoid escapists deeply intertwining their history. They are marked by their blond to silver hair and skin that's shades of blue. The Drowned, the second of wave of Elves, sought asylum too but were lost at sea in a great astral storm and mysteriously turned up in the tunnels below [[Shaterlan\|Shaterlan]]. The final wave came to claim dominion over all of [[Umm\|Umm]], but were stopped and isolated when the gate to the Astral sea was closed. Some of those who isolated at sea or who chose to stay there were warped by the seas magic and became Astral Elves.

### Gnomes

[[Gnomes of Umm\|Gnomes]] come in three different sizes: small, medium, and large, but nobody has seen the largnome in centuries. The small sort live in the South of [[Trawlittle\|Trawlittle]] among its similar sized wild life while others live in the North of [[Trawlittle\|Trawlittle]] in a spy state amongst the Ice Dwarves. The medium make live in the East of [[Stonton\|Stonton]] where the mountains meet the [[Deepwater\|Deepwater]] Lake. They live high in those mountain ranges and carve roads and city into the rock making isolated sanctuaries.

### Halflings

### Humans

[[Pot/Character Creation/Species/Humans of Pot\|Humans]] live primarily on the Eastern Coast of Pot in the Nations of [[Merusia\|Merusia]], [[Freland\|Freland]], [[Franklin\|Franklin]], and [[Merukirk\|Merukirk]] with scattered populations in [[Shaterlan\|Shaterlan]]. They also live in the Southwest on the [[Isle of Man\|Isle of Man]].

[[Pot/Character Creation/Species/Orcs of Pot\|Orcs]]: Orcs are split have three main groups Worcs, Gorcs, and Morcs, but there are many other smaller clans with similar names. Worcs are strong and sturdy with gray skin and square, blocky features. Gorcs are intelligent and devoted and with blue skin and classical Orc features, and Morcs are spiritual and empathetic with orange skin and elephant-like features.

### Teiflings

### Goblins

[[Goblins of Umm\|Goblins]]

## Magic

Pot's magic is primarily folk. These folk spells are written down and never inherent. They are cast with their specific materials and never with a replacement spellcasting focus. They are almost always cast as rituals, but some more studious or experience citizens can cast them quickly. 

However, this doesn't make magic uncommon, it just makes it either expensive or specialized. For example, the richest people, like those living in Shoe's Platton neighborhood, have house wizards who light candles and magically clean. And the chef's who having been cooking for years have minor magic imbued in their best dishes.

## Culture
As for culture, Pot is also a boiling cauldron of sentient peoples and its oldest city, the city of Shoe exemplifies this ideal. The classic races of D&D interweave themselves with many homebrew races like [[Pot/Character Creation/Species/Weirds\|Weirds]] and [[Pot/Character Creation/Species/Wildlings\|Wildlings]] in such a way that a dancing skeleton or a fish controlling a robot wouldn't warrant a second look.

The [[Pot/Lore/Deities/Deities\|deities of Pan]] are also very different from standard D&D settings. They are separated into two major categories, Titans and Gods. Titans are like forces of nature. They effect your life even if you don't know about them. They do not demand grand action, but they do ask for action in accordance with their domain. On the other hand, Gods are like people. They are powerful and temperamental. If you provide tribute, you feel great actionable, but spite them and you will feel their wrath.

## Non-magic Tech
Pan is generally low tech, with technology only as advanced as it was around the early 19th century. Black powder and steam engines are recent and highly experimental inventions and  haven't been widely adopted because of more accessible magic. Few exception exist however, like the Iron Roadrunner, a semi-magical steam train that runs from the Dwarvish mountains of Stonton across the Nailian desert to the capital of Pan.
