# Welcome to the Kingdom of Pot Setting
The Kingdom of Pot and the greater continent of Pan is a campaign setting designed around whimsy. Its inspiration is primarily taken from Adventure Time and Studio Ghibli. This manifests in themes of regrowth and reconstruction. The major cities of Pan are built upon the ruins of prehistoric civilizations and the magic of the world is weak and untapped.

## Magic
Pot's magic is primarily folk. These folk spells are written down and never inherent. They are cast with their specific materials and never with a replacement spellcasting focus. They are almost always cast as rituals, but some more studious or experience citizens can cast them quickly. 

However, this doesn't make magic uncommon, it just makes it either expensive or specialized. For example, the richest people, like those living in Shoe's Platton neighborhood, have house wizards who light candles and magically clean. And the chef's who having been cooking for years have minor magic imbued in their best dishes.

## Culture
As for culture, Pot is also a boiling cauldron of sentient peoples and its oldest city, the city of Shoe exemplifies this ideal. The classic races of D&D interweave themselves with many homebrew races like [[Pot/Character Creation/Species/Weirds (Archived)\|Weirds (Archived)]] and [[Pot/Character Creation/Species/Wildlings\|Wildlings]] in such a way that a dancing skeleton or a fish controlling a robot wouldn't warrant a second look.

The [[Pot/Lore/Deities/Deities\|deities of Pan]] are also very different from standard D&D settings. They are separated into two major categories, Titans and Gods. Titans are like forces of nature. They effect your life even if you don't know about them. They do not demand grand action, but they do ask for action in accordance with their domain. On the other hand, Gods are like people. They are powerful and temperamental. If you provide tribute, you feel great actionable, but spite them and you will feel their wrath.

## Non-magic Tech
Pan is generally low tech, with technology only as advanced as it was around the early 19th century. Black powder and steam engines are recent and highly experimental inventions and  haven't been widely adopted because of more accessible magic. Few exception exist however, like the Iron Roadrunner, a semi-magical steam train that runs from the Dwarvish mountains of Stonton across the Nailian desert to the capital of Pan.
